Source code for the Automated Chess Board.

The code is written in C and workes in unison with the SharpChess C# app.

This code was written for the MS9S12X microboard which acts as the brains for the hardware.

The code is neatly distributed among the libraries created for the specific opertaions for the microboard.

This solution was created by me and my project partner Carter Kozakevich
